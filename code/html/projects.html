            For the final project of my Grade 12 Computer Engineering class, I built, wired, and programmed an
            autonomous robot that can follow a black line of tape. One of our challenges involved getting the robot 
            to count the pieces of tape at the start of a track and navigate to the appropriate box, then to the ending position.

            For the final project in my Grade 12 Computer Science class, I worked in a group to create a 
            piece of (java) software for a teacher. My group's project was a mark tracking program that could keep track of and display 
            student marks graphically. I worked on the logic and display of a line and bar graph that tracked a student's historical performance,
            and a student's performance per category on a particular assessment. The width of each bar changes based on how heavily that category
            is weighed. You can find code for the line graph 
            <a href="../other/GraphLine.java" download>here</a>
            and code for the bar graph 
            <a href="../other/GraphBar.java" download>here.</a>

            For our Fall Team Project on the Dev Degree training path, my team chose to make a command line
            typing practice game. I worked primarily on inputting/outputting to/from a file so that historical 
            words per minute and accuracy data could be recorded, and on calculating and displaying stats including mean, median, a linear trendline, 
            and the coefficient of correlation of the data. The ruby code for calculating these stats can be found
